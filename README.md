### Auto-Converted Formats
- **AVIF** - Converted to high-quality JPG

## üê≥ Docker Usage

### Recommended Setup (Docker Compose)

1. **Copy and configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp docker/env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Tumblr and Gemini credentials and desired settings
   ```
2. **Start the system with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up -d
   ```
   This is the preferred and easiest way to run the system.

### Using Pre-built Images (Advanced)

You can also run the container directly, but Docker Compose is recommended for managing environment variables and volumes:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/jtenniswood/tumblr-agent:latest

# Run directly (not recommended for most users)
docker run -d \
  --name tumblr-agent \
  -v $(pwd)/upload:/app/data/upload \
  -v $(pwd)/staging:/app/data/failed \
  --env-file .env \
  ghcr.io/jtenniswood/tumblr-agent:latest
```
